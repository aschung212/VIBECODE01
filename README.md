# Synthwave Weather & Counter Web App

This project is a synthwave-themed interactive web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a counter, YouTube link, animated quote, and a dynamic 7-day weather forecast for San Diego with Google Calendar integration.

## Features

- **Counter Button:** Click the "Do NOT Click Me!" button to increment the counter. The button animates when pressed.
- **Decrement Profile Picture:** Click the profile picture to decrement the counter. The picture animates when pressed and is greyed out when the counter is zero.
- **YouTube Channel Link:** Displays a stylized link to your YouTube channel with a custom display name.
- **Animated Synthwave Quote:** The main quote uses a flowing synthwave gradient animation.
- **San Diego 7-Day Weather Forecast:** Weather cards show daily conditions, icons, wind, sunrise/sunset times, and more.
- **Google Calendar Integration:** Click any weather card to open a Google Calendar event page for that date.
- **Responsive Layout:** All content is centered and visually separated for clarity.

2. Click the increment button or profile picture to interact with the counter.
3. Explore the synthwave design, YouTube channel link, and weather forecast section.
