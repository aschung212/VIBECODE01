# Synthwave Counter Web App

This project is a synthwave-themed interactive web app built with Python and HTML/CSS/JS.

## Features

- **Counter Button:** Click the "Do NOT Click Me!" button to increment the counter. The button animates when pressed.
- **Decrement Profile Picture:** Click the profile picture to decrement the counter. The picture animates when pressed and is greyed out when the counter is zero.
- **YouTube Channel Link:** Displays a stylized link to your YouTube channel with a custom display name.
- **Synthwave Gradient & Animation:** The main quote uses a flowing synthwave gradient animation.
- **Responsive Layout:** All content is centered and visually separated for clarity.

## Usage

1. Open `src/aaron.html` in your browser.
2. Click the increment button or profile picture to interact with the counter.
3. Explore the synthwave design and YouTube channel link.

## File Structure

- `src/aaron.html` — Main web app
- `src/style.css` — External stylesheet for all UI styles
- `src/profilepic.jpg` — Profile picture used for decrement button
- `tests/` — Python test code (if needed)

## Customization

- Replace `profilepic.jpg` in `src/` with your own image for the profile picture.
- Update the YouTube channel link and display name in `aaron.html` as needed.
